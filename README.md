## Assignment 3: Subscription form

I have fixed the Media Queries in task 1 which makes the font size larger on mobile, but I had another issue. In this assignment I found the font size would not be larger on mobile,because the background image can not be full of the screen when it has a scrollbar. Therefore, I made the font size of the hero section's heading and tagline look similar on mobile in this assignment.
